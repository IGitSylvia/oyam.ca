      <h2>Mayo Jordanov</h2>

      <p>Since I was about five, I was interested in programming. I briefly dabbled with desktop development, but network programming and web development captured my interest. This interest compelled me to obtain my Bachelor of Science at SFU in 2006. From here, web development became my specialty.</p>

      <p>I'm a programmer and enthusiast based out of Vancouver, British Columbia. Mayo is currently working as a programmer for a company specializing in electrical grid optimization solutions. On side, he dabbles with photography, design, servers, and various web technologies.</p>

      <p>As a naturally curious person, my career has led me to branch into various areas of computing including web design, system administration, network administration, and even visual communication design. Despite the tangents, I have always come back to programming and no matter what I worked on, I have always had some sort of software project on the go, whether it be professional or as a hobby.</p>
